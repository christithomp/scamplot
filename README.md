# scamplot

This package will create a predictive plot of a logistic shape-constrained additive models. In order to apply some sort of shape constraint, it is important to first visualize the data to see which constraint would be beneficial for interpretation. The focus here is to make that process simpler by calling one function that does all the work for you.
